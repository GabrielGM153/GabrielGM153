### Hello there! I'm Gabriel GM 

## - 🖥️ 🤖 Data Scientist | Economist| BI Developer 📈 🧠🔍

## About me: 

I am an economist, and I consider it a highly versatile field both theoretically and empirically, due to the extensive application of mathematics in this discipline, whether through mathematical or probabilistic models. In general, I enjoy technology and staying constantly up to date, as this is highly enriching both personally and professionally.
I have a multidisciplinary background, and in both areas of study, I have had to develop structured thinking oriented toward problem-solving and analysis. For this reason, I directed these two elements toward data analysis and data science.

As an economist, I believe that the intersection between data science and data analysis is broad and represents a highly useful degree of quantitative specialization for the business sector. Following that idea, I developed an animation using Python (as an educational project in Spanish) that broadly explains the Leontief model. This model employs matrix algebra in analytical terms, and from it, very interesting simulations can be carried out.
